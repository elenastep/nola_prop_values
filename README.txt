Mapping Property Values in New Orleans
Elena Steponaitis
NYCDSA Scrapy Project

The aim of this project was to scrape property values and associated data from the NOLA Assessor's website: nolaassessor.com.
I selected 5 census tracts as a test of concept and used Scrapy to collect data for 2593 addresses within those tracts.

This repository contains the spider I wrote to scrape the data and a pdf describing the project and results.
