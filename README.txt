Mapping Property Values in New Orleans
Elena Steponaitis
NYCDA Scrapy Project

The aim of this project was to scrape property values and associated data from the NOLA Assessor's website: nolaassessor.com. I chose five census tracts to scrape. I then analyzedthe resulting data in QGIS.  This repository contains the spider used to scrape the assessor's website.
